This repository is part of the Master project "Characterization of volatility regimes in stock markets with machine learning" developed by Maitane SÃ¡ez.

This repository contains the following files:
- The files '^IBEX.csv', '^FCHI.csv' and '^N225.csv.csv' contain the historical data of the IBEX 35, CAC 40 and Nikkei 225 indexes, respectively. This have been obtained by accessing Yahoo Finance.

- The files '_base.py' and '_gaussian_mixture.py' files are adapted versions of the code of the sklearn.mixture package available in the link https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/master/sklearn/mixture.

- The files '_base_hmm.py' and '_hmm.py' files are adapted versions of the code of the hmmlearn package available in the link https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn/tree/master/lib/hmmlearn.

- The Jupyter Notebook 'Characterization of volatility regimes in stock markets with machine learning.ipynb' contains the code that supports the different findings of the study.
